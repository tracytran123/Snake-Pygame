# Snake-Pygame
The game involves the user controlling the movement and direction of the snake in order to capture the items of food displayed on the screen. For every food item captured results in the snake growing in length. The purpose of the game is to achieve the longest length possible without running into itself otherwise resulting in a loss.
The game ends when the user quits or loses the game by having the snake run into itself.
The snake can travel up, down, left and right which can be manipulated using the respective arrow keys.
An enhancement that could be made is to add different difficulty levels to introduce a wider audience and cater to different skills. For example, a difficult level game could include extra obstacles such as rocks or bushes that the snake cannot run into. Another feature could be to add a multiplayer option, where the player who achieves the longest snake length wins.
